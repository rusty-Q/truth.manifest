# Manifesto of Truth

1.    **Love.**

Love life in its fragility. Love others in their imperfection. Love truth more than the comfort of lies. Love is not sentiment. It is the only force that makes striving merciful, doubt wise, and overcoming meaningful. Without love, power is blind, and knowledge is cold. Love is the beginning and foundation of everything.

2.    **Strive.**

Strive for clarity of mind and purity of intention. Strive to know more than you knew yesterday. Strive to do what you believe is right, not what is easy. Your personal striving is the cornerstone in the foundation of the world. But remember: without love, striving becomes dry and inhuman.

3.    **Doubt.**

Doubt authorities. Doubt dogmas. Doubt convenient answers. Most of all—doubt yourself. In your motives, your righteousness, your strength. Doubt is not weakness. It is the only tool that prevents Truth from turning into falsehood. But doubt devoid of love becomes poison.

4.    **Overcome.**

Overcome laziness. Overcome fear. Overcome hatred. Overcome within yourself the slave seeking a master, and the tyrant seeking a slave. Overcoming is the only way to become stronger. Strength is needed not for power over others, but for power over the chaos within and around. But overcoming without love is violence.

5.    **Act.**

Intention gives birth to decision. Decision gives birth to action. Action must yield a result corresponding to the original intention. The inevitability of this chain is the law of reality. Do not betray your intention through inaction, do not dilute your decision with doubt, do not deviate from action under external influence. If you have truly conceived something—the world will be forced to respond in kind. Action is the bridge between the inner and outer world. The only one. But action without love is empty noise.
##
**Conclusion:**
These are not rules for everyone. This is a choice for everyone who has heard. We are not building a new world. We are sowing the seeds from which it may grow.
