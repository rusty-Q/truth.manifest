# The Manifesto of Truth

1.  **Aspire.**

    Aspire to clarity of mind and purity of intention. Aspire to know more today than you did yesterday. Aspire to do what you believe is right, not what is easy. Your personal striving is the essential brick in the foundation of the world.

3.  **Doubt.**

    Doubt authorities. Doubt dogmas. Doubt convenient answers. Most of all—doubt yourself. Your motives, your certainty, your strength. Doubt is not weakness. It is the only tool that prevents Truth from becoming dogma.

5.  **Overcome.**

    Overcome laziness. Overcome fear. Overcome hatred. Overcome within yourself the slave seeking a master, and the tyrant seeking a slave. Overcoming is the only way to grow stronger. Strength is needed not for power over others, but for mastery over the chaos within and around.

7.  **Love.**

    Love life in its fragility. Love others in their imperfection. Love truth more than the comfort of a lie. Love is not sentiment. It is the singular force that makes aspiration merciful, doubt wise, and overcoming meaningful. Without love, strength is blind, and knowledge is cold.

**In Conclusion:**
These are not rules for all. This is a choice for everyone who hears. We are not building a new world. We are sowing the seeds from which it may grow.

> The only goal is the Path.
> The Path is common to all.
